2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Make debian/rules executable to avoid errors in 'distclean' target.

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Modifications to create a nice ChangeLog.
	+ Add new file 'gnuify-changelog.pl' grabbed and adapted from subversion
	  distribution.
	+ Add 'ChangeLog' target to create/update ChangeLog.
	+ Update current ChangeLog.

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Really fix cabal version detection.

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Add pandoc executable to process rules as a dependency.  Make osx_dest,
	osx-pkg distinction more clear.

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Parameterise "osx-pkg".

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Add a 'osx-pkg' target for the creation of a Mac OSX® package (using
	PackageMaker.App).  This target recursively uses 'install-program'
	target to populate OSX package directory tree.

2006-10-30  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	* cabalize: fix cabal version detection by using a bloody hack.
	* Makefile:
	  + Make 'uninstall-all' depends on 'uninstall-exec'.
	  + Make the default target 'all' depends on $(BINS).  Now, invoking
	    a plain 'make' builds and creates pandoc in the top directory.

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Bug fixes to make_osx_pkg_dirs.

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Added a script to make prepare directories for creation of a
	Mac OSX package (using PackageMaker.app).

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	* Extracted installation instructions from README into a separate file,
	INSTALL.  Reason:  Only those who install from source will need the
	information in INSTALL, so it does not need to be included in user
	documentation.  Indeed, it might confuse people who install Pandoc by some
	other method.
	* Minor changes in README (using "Pandoc" as a generic name for the
	system, "'pandoc'" as a name for the executable).

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Changed date on README.

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Added a comma in README.

2006-10-29  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Remove 'install-lib', it causes too much trouble which needs to be dealed
	in ugly ways.
	+ Now, we have 'install-program' and 'install-all' targets.  The former
	  installs only program and user documents, while the latter installs
	  everything: program, user documents, library files and library documents.
	+ Behaviour of 'install' target hasn't changed, it calls 'install-program'.
	+ Update README accordingly.
	+ Implement missing uninstall-* targets (including 'uninstall-all' and
	  'uninstall-program' for the new targets).
	+ Call 'install-program' in debian/rules explicitly to prevent confusions.

2006-10-29  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Changes to RTF writer:
	+ use Helvetica instead of Times New Roman as default font
	+ specify \f0 in every \pard; otherwise font sizes are not registered properly
	+ modify test of RTF writer accordingly

2006-10-29  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Portability fix.  Remove rmdir(1)'s '--ignore-fail-on-non-empty' option, as
	it is unsupported in BSD version.  Note that the relevant line has already
	started with a '-' which means that make(1) will ignore any error.

2006-10-28  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	+ Changed debian/copyright to reflect new website location.

2006-10-28  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Remove ghc66-branch to reduce clutter.

2006-10-28  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Merge trunk with ghc66-branch.

2006-10-28  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Tag current trunk as pandoc-0.21.

2006-10-28  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Portability fixes:
	+ '+' meta character apparently doesn't work with BSD's sed (without using
	  an extra option).  Just removing this character should be sufficient, as
	  we have now used an unquoted variable at the problematic sed line (see
	  the previous commit) and there is no extra space to remove.
	+ '-D' option of BSD's install(1) doesn't work as expected.  Modify code to
	  not use this option at all.

2006-10-28  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Unquote a variable in cabalize to have the problematic leading and trailing
	spaces removed in shell expansion.

2006-10-28  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Acknowledge roktas's contributions in README.

2006-10-28  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	+ fixed html2markdown usage message, in which w3m occured twice
	+ added usage documentation to beginning of fillTemplates.pl

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Merge ghc66-branch with the latest changes in trunk.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Use @HS_SOURCE_DIRS@ in substitution.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Handle 'Hs-Source-Dir[s]*' option in cabalize to get rid of warnings.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Minor corrections.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Add "-o | --output" option to markdown2pdf, update man file.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Wording changes in man files.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Merge ghc66-branch with trunk.  Just a future note for this operation:
	+ Do an 'svn log' at the top of the repository.
	+ Observe that we had created this branch at revision 6.
	+ Now, chdir to ghc66-branch wc and merge all changes from revision 6
	  to HEAD:
	    svn merge -r6:HEAD https://pandoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
	+ Make sure that we have no conflicts and commit all changes (as I'm
	  doing right now).

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Cleanup cabalize script.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Minor wording change in README.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Modified package descriptions in debian/control.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Give full download URL in debian/copyright.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Fixed jgm's email address in debian changelog.

2006-10-27  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Minor corrections and improvements to README.

2006-10-27  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Replace awk with sed in cabalize.

2006-10-25  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	* Revert lib/executable build separation change.  Unfortunately previously
	  explained method creates '*.{o,hi}' files in src tree which I've just
	  noticed.  As this "twice build' issue is a regression from GHC 6.4, I
	  strongly believe that it's a bug or a wrong implementation.  Let's leave
	  this issue for the moment.

2006-10-25  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Preliminary work for GHC 6.6.
	* Improve build time configuration.
	  + New file 'Pandoc.cabal.in' to create Pandoc.cabal by preprocessing it
	    at build time.  Remove Pandoc.cabal.
	  + New file 'cabalize' to preprocess Pandoc.cabal.in.  This script detects
	    GHC version and setup things accordingly.  Following is the excerpt
	    from GHC 6.6 anouncement:
	    - The Text.Html and Text.Html.BlockTable modules have now been removed,
	      with the new html and xhtml packages providing replacements.
	    - The Text.Regex and Text.Regex.Posix modules have been removed.
	      Instead, use the new regex-compat package for a drop-in Text.Regex
	      replacement, or the new library in the new regex-posix package.
	    Now, for GHC 6.6, we have to list 'regex-compat' and 'html' modules in
	    Build-Depends; and for GHC 6.4, we have to omit them since they already
	    exist in base.
	  + Remove 'configure' and 'Pandoc.buildinfo.in' as they are replaced by
	    'cabalize' and 'Pandoc.cabal.in'.
	  + Simplify 'Setup.hs'.
	* Compile pandoc executable separately for the reasons depicted below;
	  modify Makefile, debian/rules and Pandoc.cabal accordingly (the latter
	  does no more have an Executable section):
	  + New cabal (unfortunately) compiles all the library files _twice_; once
	    when building library, and twice when building pandoc itself.  Second
	    compilation is unnecessary since we have the library already compiled
	    and just statically linking Main.o should have been sufficient.  This
	    is a regression from GHC 6.4 (it doesn't behave this way).  As a
	    solution for this problem, we now compile Main.hs separately and
	    _statically_ link Main.o with dist/build/*.a.
	  + Separating the program binary build from library build simplifies both
	    the Makefile and debian/rules.
	  Note that, for the upcoming Cabal versions it is planned to use different
	  cabal files for libraries and executables.  So (perhaps in GHC 6.8) we'll
	  probably have to change this code again.
	* Simplify some parts of Makefile and debian/rules by exploiting the lib vs
	  executable build separation.
	* Add libghc6-html-dev to package Depends.  This is a new package in Debian
	  package archive and it includes the 'html' module which is no more
	  available in ghc6 package.  Due to this change, 'deb' target in Makefile
	  won't work in older Debian systems having only ghc 6.4.  But as ghc <=6.4
	  support will be dropped in Etch, this will hardly become an issue.
	* Increment pandoc version for later changes.  Note that, we have to
	  increment Debian package version whenever we made a change, but maybe we
	  should keep the major version number in Pandoc.cabal and just increment a
	  minor version in debian/changelog (e.g. 0.2 in Pandoc.cabal, 0.2x in
	  debian/changelog).

2006-10-25  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	Create branch for GHC 6.6 transition.

2006-10-20  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	* Fix man files installation so that we really ignore .svn directories.
	* Remove $datadir/doc/pandoc on uninstall-doc.  Only this directory is
	  removed since it's a cruft directory due to its name. I couldn't find
	  a reliable method to remove other directories created on installation.
	* Use fakeroot when invoking dpkg-buildpackage.  Improve warnings in
	  'deb' target.

2006-10-20  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	Added markdown2html to bin_all.

2006-10-18  Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

	As we are using subversion, ignore '.svn' directories when building debs.

2006-10-17  John MacFarlane <jgm@berkeley.edu>

	initial import
