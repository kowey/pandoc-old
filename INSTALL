% Installing Pandoc

# Installing GHC

To compile Pandoc, you'll need [GHC] version 6.4 or greater.  If
you don't have GHC already, you can get it from the [GHC Download]
page.

[GHC]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
[GHC Download]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html

You'll also need standard build tools: GNU `make`, `sed`, `bash`,
and `perl`.  These are standard on unix systems (including MacOS
X).  If you're using Windows, you can install [Cygwin].

# Installing Pandoc

1.  Change to the directory containing the Pandoc distribution.

2.  Compile:

        make

3.  See if it worked (optional, but recommended): 

        make test

4.  Install:

        sudo make install

    Note:  This installs `pandoc`, together with its wrappers and
    documentation, into the `/usr/local` directory.  If you don't
    have root privileges or would prefer to install `pandoc` and
    the associated wrappers into your `~/bin` directory, type
    this instead:

        PREFIX=~ make install-exec

5.  Build and install the Haskell libraries and library
    documentation (optional):

        make build-all
        sudo make install-all

# Removing Pandoc

Each of the installation steps described above can be reversed:

    sudo make uninstall

    PREFIX=~ make uninstall-exec

    sudo make uninstall-all
