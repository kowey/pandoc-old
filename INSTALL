% Installing Pandoc

# Installing GHC

To compile Pandoc, you'll need [GHC] version 6.4 or greater. 

If you don't have GHC already, you can get it from the 
[GHC Download] page.

[GHC]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
[GHC Download]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html

You'll also need standard build tools: GNU `make`, `sed`, `bash`, and `perl`.
These are standard on unix systems (including MacOS X).  If you're
using Windows, you can install [Cygwin].

# Installing Pandoc

1.  Change to the directory containing the Pandoc distribution.

2.  Compile:

        make

3.  See if it worked (optional, but recommended): 

        make test

4.  Install:

        make install

    Note:  This installs `pandoc`, together with its wrappers and
    documentation, into the `/usr/local` directory, which requires root
    privileges.  If you don't have root privileges or would prefer to
    install `pandoc` and the associated shell scripts into your `~/bin`
    directory, type this instead:

        PREFIX=~ make install-exec

5.  Install everthing, including Haskell libraries and library documentation 
    (optional):

        make install-all

# Removing Pandoc

Each of the installation steps described above can be reversed:

    make uninstall

    PREFIX=~ make uninstall-exec

    make uninstall-all
