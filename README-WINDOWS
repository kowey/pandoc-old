These instructions pertain to the Windows binary distribution of Pandoc.
If you are installing from source on Windows (using Cygwin), you can ignore
these instructions and go directly to README.

The Windows binary distribution contains the following files:

  - `README-WINDOWS.txt` - this file
  - `README.txt` - instructions for using Pandoc
  - `COPYING.txt` - the license under which Pandoc is distributed
  - `COPYRIGHT.txt` - copyright information
  - pandoc.exe - the Pandoc program

To use Pandoc, copy `pandoc.exe` to a directory that is in your PATH,
or to the directory you wish to work in.

Open up a command shell.  Change to the directory you wish to work in.
Try typing

    pandoc -h

If you get a usage message, then you're ready to start using Pandoc.
See `README.txt` for further instructions.

Note:  the wrapper scripts `markdown2pdf` and `web2markdown` are not
included with the Windows distribution.  If you want to use them, install
[Cygwin] and ...

((better idea:  put these in a subdirectory so people can get to them,
optionally, if they have cygwin))

((also put in a note about links.  I suppose they could just copy pandoc
to all the others; this would waste disk space, but it would work.))
