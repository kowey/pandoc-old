Notes to Debian users on "suggested" dependencies:

If you intend to use the markdown2pdf script, you should install
texlive-latex-recommended (or, if you use teTeX, tetex-extra). This
provides LaTeX packages that are needed by markdown2pdf.

If you intend to use the html2markdown script, you should install
tidy, plus either wget or w3m.
