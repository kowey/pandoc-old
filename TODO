# TODO

*   Use new downloads feature on google code.  Figure out naming
    scheme for releases.

*   state license on first page of website.  also at top of every
    source file...some say? (c) date, and license with link to text.

*   Clean up Haskell code, refactor, etc.

*   new writers?  man page! (but we'd really need definition lists),
    docbook.

*   Use XHTML library for HTML writer?  Not yet - it's not standard
    with 6.4.2 (but is with 6.6).  When we can drop support for 
    6.4.2, we can use it.

*   Windows zipfile:  zip -r pandoc-0.3-windows.zip pandoc.exe README LICENSE
    Be sure to convert to Windows line-endings. 
    in bash: sed -e 's/$'"/`echo \\\r`/" README > README.txt

*   pandoc's HTML output fails to validate completely (w3c).
    There are a few quirks:
    + HTML doesn't like the \> at the end of <meta tags.
      But if we remove them, we'll have trouble with S5 output,
      which seems to need the xhtml header?
    + There's also a problem with the email obfuscation scheme.
      <noscript> isn't allowed inside <p> blocks.  <script> is
      allowed!  Options:
          - come up with another scheme, perhaps more like markdown.pl's
            See the nice idea at http://subversion.tigris.org/security.html,
            using spans.
          - ignore the validation problems
          - others?

*   Consider adding support for acronyms.
    Perhaps like this:  [AAAS]
      [AAAS]: "American association for the advancement of science"
    <acronym title="American association for the advancement 
    of science">AAAS</acronym>
