pandoc (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Revamped build process to conform to debian standards and created
    a proper debian package.  Closes: #391666.

  * Modified build process to support GHC 6.6.
    + The package can still be compiled using GHC 6.4.2, though because
      of dependencies the "make deb" target works only with GHC 6.6+.
    + The script 'cabalize' is used to create an appropriate
      'Pandoc.cabal' from 'Pandoc.cabal.in', depending on the GHC and
      Cabal versions.

  * Refactored template processing (fillTemplates.pl).

  * Modified wrapper scripts to make them more robust.

  * Modified wrapper scripts to make them more robust and portable.
    To avoid code duplication and ensure consistency, wrappers are 
    generated via a templating system from templates in src/wrappers.
    + New command line convention allows options to be passed to
      pandoc, as follows:
        1st form: input files specified
          <wrapper> [wrapper_arg...] input_files... [pandoc_option...]
        2nd form: using STDIN, no input file is specified
          <wrapper> [wrapper_arg...] -- [pandoc_option...]
        3rd form: input files specified, optional '--'
          <wrapper> [wrapper_arg...] input_files... -- [pandoc_option...]
    + All wrappers except 'html2markdown' and 'latex2markdown' now
      accept multiple filenames.
    + getopts shell builtin is used for portable option parsing.
    + Spaces and tabs allowed in filenames.
    + Improved html2markdown's web grabber code, making it more robust,
      configurable and verbose.  Added '-e', '-n', '-g' options.
      Possible use case:
        # Use wget by setting timeout to 10 seconds and limit retries
        to 2.  html2markdown -g 'wget --timeout=10 --tries=2'
    + Added tests for wrappers' processing of command line arguments.

  * Added '-o' option to markdown2pdf.

  * Revised RTF writer:
    + Default font is now Helvetica.
    + An \f0 is added to each \pard, so that font resizing works correctly.

  * Fixed handling of dashes in LaTeX writer:
    + Recognize a double hyphen as an Em-dash, even when it occurs next
      to punctuation (e.g. a quotation mark).
    + Collapse space around Em-dashes.
    + Process quotes before dashes.  This way (foo -- 'bar') will turn into
      (foo---`bar') instead of (foo---'bar').

  * Minor improvements to LaTeX reader:
    + Fixed parsing of metadata.  Now the title, author, and date
      are parsed correctly.  Everything else in the preamble is skipped.
    + Modified escapedChar to allow a \ at the end of a line to count
      as escaped whitespace.
    + '\thanks' now treated like a footnote.    
    + Simplified parsing of LaTeX command arguments and options.
      commandArgs now returns a list of arguments OR options (in
      whatever order they appear).  The brackets are included, and
      a new stripFirstAndLast function is provided to strip them off
      when needed.  This fixes a problem in dealing with \newcommand
      and \newenvironment.

  * Fixed bug in notFollowedBy' combinator (adding 'try' before 'parser').
    Adjusted code that uses this combinator accordingly.

  * Made handling of code blocks more consistent.  Previously, some
    readers allowed trailing newlines, while others stripped them.
    Now, all readers strip trailing newlines in code blocks. Writers
    insert a newline at the end of code blocks as needed.

  * Changed HTML writer to include title block in header even
    when title is null.

  * Revised pandoc wrapper scripts to pipe output (as well as input)
    through iconv.

  * Added osx-pkg and osx-dmg targets to Makefile:
    + osx-pkg creates a Mac OS X package (directory); osx-dmg creates a 
      compressed disk image containing the package.
    + New osx directory contains files needed for construction
      of the package.

  * Added website target to generate pandoc's website automatically.

  * Added code to html2markdown that tries to determine the character 
    encoding of an HTML file, by parsing the "Content-type" meta tag.
    + If the encoding can't be determined, then if the content is local,
      the local encoding is used; if it comes from a URL, UTF-8 is used 
      by default.
    + Encoding can be specified explicitly using '-e' option.

  * Improved warning messages:
    + Print warning if iconv not available
    + More user-friendly error messages in markdown2pdf, when
      pdflatex fails.

  * Rewrote documentation and man pages.  Split README into INSTALL
    and README.
