  * New release with new build system and proper debian package

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Revamped build process to conform to debian standards and created
    a proper debian package.  Closes: #391666.

  * Modified build process to support GHC 6.6.
    + The package can still be compiled using GHC 6.4.2, though because
      of dependencies the "make deb" target works only with GHC 6.6+.
    + The script 'cabalize' is used to create an appropriate
      'Pandoc.cabal' from 'Pandoc.cabal.in', depending on the GHC and
      Cabal versions.

  * Refactored template processing (fillTemplates.pl).
	
  * Modified wrapper scripts to make them more robust.

  * Added '--output' option to markdown2pdf.

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Revised RTF writer:
    + Default font is now Helvetica.
    + An \f0 is added to each \pard, so that font resizing works correctly.

  * Fixed handling of dashes in LaTeX writer:
    + Recognize a double hyphen as an Em-dash, even when it occurs next
      to punctuation (e.g. a quotation mark).
    + Collapse space around Em-dashes.
    + Process quotes before dashes.  This way (foo -- 'bar') will turn into
      (foo---`bar') instead of (foo---'bar').

  * Revised pandoc wrapper scripts to pipe output (as well as input)
    through iconv.

  * Added osx-pkg and osx-dmg targets to Makefile:
    + osx-pkg creates a Mac OS X package (directory); osx-dmg creates a 
      compressed disk image containing the package.
    + New osx directory contains files needed for construction
      of the package.

  * Rewrote documentation and man pages.  Split README into INSTALL
    and README.
