Pandoc will be installed into your `@PREFIX@` directory.  In order
to use `pandoc` and the associated wrapper scripts, you must have
`/usr/local/bin` in your `PATH.`   To add `/usr/local/bin` to your
default path, add these lines to the end of `.profile` in your home
directory and open a new terminal window:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    export MANPATH=/usr/local/man:$MANPATH

To uninstall Pandoc at any time, use the following command:

    sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-pandoc
