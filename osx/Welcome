% OS X Installation Notes

Pandoc will be installed into your `@PREFIX@` directory.  In order
to use `pandoc` and the associated wrapper scripts, you must have
`@PREFIX@/bin` in your `PATH.`   To add `@PREFIX@/bin` to your
default path, add these lines to the end of `.profile` in your home
directory:

    export PATH=$PATH:@PREFIX@/bin
    export MANPATH=$MANPATH:@PREFIX@/share/man

You will have to open a new terminal window for these changes
to take effect.

To uninstall Pandoc at any time, use the following command:

    sudo @PREFIX@/bin/uninstall-pandoc
