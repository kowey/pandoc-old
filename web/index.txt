% Pandoc

`pandoc` is a [Haskell] library for converting from one markup format
to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read
[markdown] and (subsets of) [reStructuredText], [HTML], and [LaTeX],
and it can write [markdown], [reStructuredText], [HTML], [LaTeX], [RTF],
and [S5] HTML slide shows. `pandoc`'s version of markdown contains some
enhancements, like footnotes and embedded LaTeX.

In contrast to existing tools for converting markdown to HTML, which
use regex substitutions, `pandoc` has a modular design: it consists of a
set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a native
representation of the document, and a set of writers, which convert
this native representation into a target format. Thus, adding an input
or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.
