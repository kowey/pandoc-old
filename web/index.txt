% Pandoc

Pandoc is a [Haskell] library for converting from one markup format
to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read
[markdown] and (subsets of) [reStructuredText], [HTML], and [LaTeX],
and it can write [markdown], [reStructuredText], [HTML], [LaTeX], [RTF],
and [S5] HTML slide shows. Pandoc's version of markdown contains some
enhancements, like footnotes and embedded LaTeX.

In contrast to existing tools for converting markdown to HTML, which
use regex substitutions, Pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a
set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a native
representation of the document, and a set of writers, which convert
this native representation into a target format. Thus, adding an input
or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.

For more information, see the [README](README.html) file.

Pandoc is free software, released under the [GPL].

**Source distribution:** [`@TARBALL_NAME@`].
To install, unpack the archive and follow the instructions in the
[INSTALL](INSTALL.html) file. You'll need the [GHC] Haskell compiler,
version 6.4 or higher.

**MacOS X binary package:** [`@OSX_DMG_NAME@`].
To install, just double-click the package icon in the disk
image.  See the [installation notes](osx-notes.html) for important
information about setting your `PATH`.  Note:  This package was
compiled on a G4 Mac; it will also work on an Intel Mac via emulation.

**Windows binary package:**  [`@WINDOWS_PKG_NAME@`].
The zip file contains the `pandoc.exe` command-line program (which
you should extract from the zip archive and put somewhere in your
PATH).  See the included file `README-WINDOWS.txt` for instructions
on using the program.  Note:  If you use [Cygwin], we recommend that
you compile Pandoc from source.  This will give you access to the
wrapper scripts `markdown2pdf` and `web2markdown`, which are not
included in the Windows binary package.
