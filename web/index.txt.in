% Pandoc

# Overview

Pandoc is a [Haskell] library for converting from one markup format
to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read
[markdown] and (subsets of) [reStructuredText], [HTML], and [LaTeX],
and it can write [markdown], [reStructuredText], [HTML], [LaTeX], [ConTeXt],
[RTF], [DocBook XML], [groff man], and [S5] HTML slide shows. 

Pandoc features

- Modular design, using separate writers and readers for each
  supported format.
- A real markdown parser, not based on regex substitutions.
  [More accurate] and [much faster] than `Markdown.pl`.
- Also parses (subsets of) reStructuredText, LaTeX, and HTML.
- Multiple output formats: HTML, Docbook XML, LaTeX, ConTeXt,
  reStructuredText, Markdown, RTF, groff man pages, S5 slide shows.
- Unicode support.
- Optional "smart" quotes, dashes, and ellipses.
- Automatically generated tables of contents.
- [ASCIIMathML] support for equations in HTML.
- Extensions to markdown syntax:
    + Document metadata (title, author, date).
    + Footnotes, tables, and definition lists.
    + Superscripts, subscripts, and strikeout.
    + Inline LaTeX math and LaTeX commands.
    + Markdown inside HTML blocks.
    + Enhanced ordered lists:  start number and numbering style
      are significant.
    + Compatibility mode to turn off syntax entensions and emulate
      `Markdown.pl`.
- Convenient wrapper scripts:
    + `html2markdown` makes it easy to produce a markdown version
      of any web page.
    + `markdown2pdf` converts markdown to PDF in one step.
    + `hsmarkdown` is a drop-in replacement for `Markdown.pl`.
- Multi-platform:  runs on Windows, MacOS X, Linux, Unix.
- Free software, released under the [GPL].

# News

-   Version 0.43 released (September 2, 2007).

    + HUGE increase in performance:  markdown is parsed five times
      faster than with 0.42 on large benchmark files.
    + Prettyprinting library used in LaTeX writer, so that LaTeX output
      is wrapped and intelligently indented.
    + Fixed bugs in LaTeX ordered lists and LaTeX command and environment
      parsers.
    + Blank lines are no longer required after code blocks.
    + Fixed inline code parsing so that it uses the method of Markdown.pl:
      the delimiters are blocks of N `` ` `` characters not followed by another
      `` ` `` character.  For example:
      ```` ` h ``` i ` ```` -> `<code>h ``` i</code>`.
    + Markdown writer escapes paragraphs that begin like list items.
    + MacPorts Portfile now installs library as well as executable.
    + Added pandocwiki demonstration to the website.
 
-   Version 0.42 released (August 26, 2007).

    + Fixes bugs in ordered list handling, LaTeX footnotes,
      UTF8 in include files, and HTML tables.  See [changelog] for details.
    + Added new rule for enhanced ordered lists:  capital letters
      followed by periods must be separated from the list item by
      two spaces, to avoid misinterpretation of initials.  See
      [README](README.html#lists) for details.
    + Improved strict markdown compatibility.
    + OSX packages are no longer supported. There were too many issues with
      dynamic libraries. Instead, a MacPorts Portfile is now provided.
    + Exposed Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML.

-   Version 0.41 released (August 19, 2007).

    + Fixes bugs in the handling of ordered lists and raw HTML.
      For details, see the [changelog].

-   Version 0.4 released (August 15, 2007).

    For users:

    + New output formats:  ConTeXt and groff man.
    + Support for definition lists and tables.
    + Support for superscript, subscript, and strikeout.
    + Support for automatically generated tables of contents.
    + Automatically generated unique identifiers in HTML headers.
    + Enhanced ordered lists (start number and list number style
      are now significant).
    + Markdown links now printed as inline links by default,
      unless `--reference-links` option is specified.
    + Many bugs fixed.

    For programmers:

    + Added a Text.Pandoc module that exports the main functions
      and data structures. Library documentation includes a sample
      program using the library.

    Under the hood:

    + Refactored to avoid reliance on GHC's `Text.Regex`, which
      is slow and does not support unicode.
    + Removed Key and Note block elements and simplified parsers.
    + Improved handling of character entities.
    + HTML output is now generated using `Text.XHtml`.
